# Research Workflow

This document outlines the research workflow used by The-Walker AI Research Assistant.

## Overview

The research workflow is designed to be efficient and resource-conscious, making it suitable for running on laptops and desktops with limited GPU resources. It follows an iterative process that balances thoroughness with performance.

## Workflow Steps

1. **Initialize Research**
   - Set up the initial state with the research topic
   - Generate a working title

2. **Thesis Formulation**
   - Generate a clear, focused thesis statement to guide the research
   - Ensure the thesis is specific and debatable

3. **Literature Survey**
   - Generate targeted search queries
   - Perform web searches using Tavily API
   - Gather and format sources
   - Create a comprehensive literature summary

4. **Validation Check**
   - Evaluate the sufficiency of the literature survey
   - Check for comprehensiveness, depth, currency, and relevance
   - Determine if more research is needed

5. **Knowledge Gap Identification**
   - Analyze the research to identify specific knowledge gaps
   - Prioritize gaps that are directly relevant to the thesis
   - Format gaps with descriptions, importance, and research questions

6. **Targeted Research**
   - Address identified knowledge gaps one by one
   - Generate specific search queries for each gap
   - Gather additional sources and integrate findings
   - Update the literature summary with new information

7. **Research Summary Generation**
   - Create a comprehensive summary of all research findings
   - Integrate literature survey and targeted research results
   - Present a cohesive narrative supporting the thesis

8. **Paper Outline Generation**
   - Create a structured outline for the research paper
   - Organize sections logically with clear progression of ideas
   - Include main points and supporting evidence for each section

9. **Section Drafting**
   - Write each section of the paper based on the outline
   - Ensure proper academic writing conventions
   - Maintain logical flow and coherence within sections

10. **Completion Check**
    - Verify that all required sections are complete
    - Ensure the paper has a cohesive structure

11. **Cross-Section Coherence Check**
    - Evaluate consistency and logical flow across sections
    - Check for alignment with the thesis statement
    - Identify any redundancies or contradictions

12. **Citation Formatting**
    - Format all sources according to the specified citation style
    - Generate in-text citations and reference list entries
    - Ensure proper attribution of all referenced work

13. **Final Paper Assembly**
    - Integrate all sections into a cohesive whole
    - Add necessary transitions between sections
    - Create a polished, publication-ready document

## Resource Optimization

The workflow includes several optimizations for resource-constrained environments:

- Limited research loops to prevent excessive API calls
- Focused search queries to get relevant results efficiently
- Controlled token generation for better performance
- Reduced thread count for better performance on limited CPUs
- Optimized for use with GGUF quantized models
